Day Three // 30 days of React challenge // "Random Colour Picker" app.

This is a React.js app that generates a random colour with corresponding rgb code.

Follow me *programming noob* as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.
By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications
